## 📄 Baptism and Confirmation Record

### Record and Certificate Process

Before a child who is a member of record is interviewed for baptism:

1. **Clerk** uses LCR to prepare a **Baptism and Confirmation Form**
2. **Bishop or assigned counselor** conducts the interview and signs the form
3. After baptism and confirmation, a **clerk** uses this form to update the child's membership record in LCR
4. After the membership record is created, a **clerk** prepares a **Baptism and Confirmation Certificate**
5. Certificate is signed by the **bishop** and given to the person

> **⚠️ Important:** The name on the membership record and certificate should match the birth certificate, civil birth registry, or current legal name.
